method
To access the flag there are 2 methods.
1: use sql injection to find the hidden directorys
2: use gobuster to find the hidden directorys

Method 1:
using inspect element. The username for the directorys can be found in some divs
A peice of code that bypasses the password field can be found under a div with backdoor password = ' OR 1 = '1
This modifies the password field, to password = '' OR 1='1'. As such as long as the username is correct you will have access to theinformation
the ' closes the password field, OR means that either the password or something else needs to be correct. 1='1 checks if the number 1 is equll to the char 1
the closing ' is from the original password field. In sql 1='1' return true
The main goal of an sql injection bypass is to get somesort of return true value to gain access.
Using the sql injection the location of the images,data and files directorys that contina the flag

Method2:
The second method to find the directorys is to use the provided wordlist and the program gobuster to brute force find the hidden directorys
this method is more stragitforward to perform



Once the hidden directorys are found the flag can be aquired as below
data contains information on how the flag is obscured and stored and indirectly informs the person on how to get the flag
files is a red hering/joke that does nothing
images contains an image that appears normal
this image however contains an zip archive appended to the end.
opening this image in a normal image viewer would only yield the image and no information\
however if it is opened and extracted with a zipextracter a textdocument containing the flag.
