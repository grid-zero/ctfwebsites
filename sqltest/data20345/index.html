This website uses the SQL data base language to securly store all our data. <br>Location of the files are stored in hidden directorys that can only be accsesed through finding the filepath through quering our SQL datbase.<br>
SQL stands for Secure Quantum Language and as everyone knows quantum computing is the most secure method of storage.<br>
<br>
The data stored is even further encoded by appending a zip to the end of an image. <br>This allows are operaters to send the encrypted files through images and bad actors who may intercept communications will never realise the data hidden in plain sight.<br>
<br>
An even further method of encryption is that the files are encodede in base 64 so to any passerbyers who do happen to see the files, they do not even appear to be images,<br> only random data. Of course explaining this here is fine because to access this page you need to have access to the super secure password and find the location of this page.<br> As we use Quantem entanglement to store this page only those who it is intended to be seen by will be able to see it.
