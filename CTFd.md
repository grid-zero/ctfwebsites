# Challenge : Find my files (c)(r)
  

Can you help? I seem to have misplaced my super secret password on [this](http://localhost/) web server.

Can you get it for me?

The only thing I remember is that it sorta looked like secretData{password}.  

It is stored Somewhere on the webserver, hidden away.
